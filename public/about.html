<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A motivated and fast-thinking Programmer with ample experience working with a self-startup game company looking for 
  new opportunities to develop his career and bring his skills to new projects.</p>

<p>As one of five co-founders of startup game company Clockwork Giants, I have gained a plethora of experience working 
  with people and in different roles. This flexibility led me to create and release Lareissa Everbright on Steam as the 
  sole developer while still working on Clockwork Giantâ€™s Introspect. Though I am used to a multi-faceted workload and 
  wearing many hats, at my core I am a qualified programmer with professional experience working in C++ and C#. I have 
  a thirst for learning new skills and wish to enter a role where I can further grow as a developer and apply my learnt 
  abilities to exciting projects.</p>
